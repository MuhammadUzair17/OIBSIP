# **House Price Prediction with Linear Regression**

## **Overview**
This project involves predicting house prices using a linear regression model. The objective is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates house prices based on key features. The project covers data collection, exploration, feature selection, and model training, concluding with a comparison of predicted and actual values.

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset used in this project includes numerical features and a target variable representing house prices. Key steps involved:
- **Data Collection:** Obtaining a dataset with features relevant to house price prediction.
- **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Exploring the structure of the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying critical features that influence house prices.

## **Tools and Technologies**
- **Python:** Used for data processing and machine learning.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Implementing the linear regression model.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Environment for conducting and documenting the analysis.

## **Steps Taken**
### 1. **Data Collection**
Acquired a dataset containing relevant numerical features and the target variable (house prices).

### 2. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**
- Explored the dataset to understand its structure and distribution.
- Handled missing values by imputing or removing incomplete records.
- Validated data quality for model reliability.

### 3. **Feature Selection**
Identified features with strong correlations to the target variable using statistical and domain-specific insights.

### 4. **Model Training**
- Implemented a linear regression model using Scikit-Learn.
- Trained the model on a portion of the dataset and tested it on unseen data.

### 5. **Visualization**
Created visualizations to compare predicted house prices against actual values, illustrating the model's performance.

## **Prerequisites**
- Python installed on your machine.
- Required libraries: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the process of building a predictive model using linear regression. By following systematic steps, from data collection to visualization, the project showcases how machine learning can be used to derive insights and make accurate predictions in the real estate domain.

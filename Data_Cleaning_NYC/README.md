# **Data Cleaning with Python**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on data cleaning techniques to ensure the quality and usability of datasets for analysis. The primary objective is to enhance data integrity, handle missing values, remove duplicates, standardize formats, and detect outliers. These steps are critical for accurate and reliable data analysis.

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset used for this project includes multiple features requiring cleaning and preprocessing to ensure consistency and accuracy. The specific cleaning tasks applied are:
- **Data Integrity:** Ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the data.
- **Missing Data Handling:** Managing missing values through imputation or other informed strategies.
- **Duplicate Removal:** Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to maintain uniqueness.
- **Standardization:** Applying consistent formatting and units across the dataset.
- **Outlier Detection:** Identifying and handling anomalies for more precise analysis.

## **Tools and Technologies**
- **Python:** The primary language for data cleaning.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Re (Regular Expressions):** For text and pattern-based cleaning tasks.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Used for conducting and documenting the data cleaning process.

## **Steps Taken**
### 1. **Data Import**
Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for processing.

### 2. **Data Cleaning Techniques**
- **Handling Missing Values:** Used imputation strategies where appropriate or excluded incomplete records based on context.
- **Duplicate Removal:** Identified duplicate rows using Pandas and removed them to avoid redundancy.
- **Data Standardization:** Ensured consistent formatting (e.g., date formats, units of measurement).
- **Outlier Detection:** Identified outliers using statistical techniques and treated them appropriately.

### 3. **Validation**
- Verified the datasetâ€™s integrity post-cleaning to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## **Prerequisites**
- Python installed on your machine.
- Required libraries: Pandas, Re.

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the ability to clean and preprocess datasets effectively. By addressing issues like missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies, and outliers, the data becomes more reliable for subsequent analysis. The methods used here can be applied to various datasets to improve data quality and analytical outcomes.

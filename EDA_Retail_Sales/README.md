- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Product Category**: Category of the product sold (e.g., Clothing, Beauty, Electronics).
- **Quantity**: Number of units sold in each transaction.
- **Price per Unit**: Cost per unit of the product.
- **Total Amount**: Total revenue generated from each transaction.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: A core programming language for data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib**: Utilized for data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Used to enhance visualizations with advanced plots.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment for conducting and documenting the analysis.
